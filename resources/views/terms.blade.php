							<p class="pb-4">
								As one of the largest Web Hosting companies in
								the world, with hundreds of thousands of sites and and
								thousands more created daily, we are unable
								to catch all violations as sites are created.
								Our sites are also edited 24 hours a day and
								seven days a week, internationally, which
								makes the task of preventing inappropriate
								use of our services impossible as the content
								is being created.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-4">
								With this many users, we take great pride in allowing
								these users to express their interests and
								communicate with others in a positive environment.
								We understand that many users also use our
								services for negative purposes, such as defamation
								of character in the form of libel. We are
								also aware that many users post information
								or images of others without the consent of
								the individuals.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-4">
								WebStarts is aware that the person that has created
								an inappropriate site can do so again, either
								with our services or using one of the many
								other services on the web, should we simply
								delete the site. It is for this reason that
								we take the approach of confronting the problem
								in hopes of nurturing a positive reaction
								from the violator.

							<h5 class="text-paragraph pb-2">WebStarts Civil Subpoena Policy</h5>

								Federal Express - Cost as Billed<br>

								false complaints we receive, we do not freeze
								or delete a site unless we find a violation
								of our Terms-of-Service. Also, if your child
								has come across a WebStarts site which you
								find inappropriate, please inform us of this,
								but be aware that they most likely found this
								site after having been given the address from
								a friend. It might better suit your purposes
								to address the situation offline as well as
								reporting it to us.

							</p>
							<p class="pb-4">
								WebStarts treats all abuse violations on a case by case
								basis. Violations which fall into this category
								sometimes cannot be determined by expressing
								a definition, but there are some guidelines
								which can be used to determine if the content
								on a site is in violation of our Terms-of-Service.<br>
								<br>
								Please review the following guidelines:
							</p>

							<ul class="ml-4 pb-4 list-disc list-inside">

									Adult images are any nude images of the
									human or humanoid form which depict the
									nude body in a manner other than in the
									classical style (i.e. the Statue of David,

									Contemporary nude &quot;art&quot; is considered
									adult content and is in violation of our
									Term-of-Service.
								</li>
								<li>
									Artistic nudes in the classical style
									must be content specific. If such an image
									is used, it must fall in line with the theme
									of the site. Alterations of the work for
									any purpose will be considered a violation
									of our Terms-of-Service.
								</li>
								<li>
									Any text which describes, refers to, or
									alludes to services, stories, or products
									of an adult or sexual nature is a violation
									of our terms.

									or group of people based on sex, color,
									creed, practices, or orientation
								</li>
								<li>
									Users may not publish material that promotes hate toward groups based on race
									or ethnic origin, religion, disability,
									gender, age, veteran status,
									and sexual orientation/gender identity.
								</li>
								<li>
									Content depicting or referring to the
									harm of others, animals, or property
								</li>
